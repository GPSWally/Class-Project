"IL099"|6|"CSP"|"Calcareous spot"|"A spot where the surface layer contains carbonates in areas ahere the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit is non calcareous. Effervecence can be detected by dilute hydrochloric acid. Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191090"
"IL099"|6|"DEP"|"Depression, closed"|"A shallow, saucer-shaped area that is slightly lower on the landscape than the surrounding area and is without a natural outlet for surface drainage.  Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191091"
"IL099"|6|"DSS"|"Disturbed soil spot"|"An Area in which the soil has been removed and materials redeposited due to human activity. Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191092"
"IL099"|6|"ERO"|"Severely eroded spot"|"An area where on the average 75 percent or more of the original surface layer has been lost because of accelerated erosion.  Not used in map units that are named severely eroded, very severely eroded, or gullied.  Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191093"
"IL099"|6|"ESB"|"Escarpment, bedrock"|"A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which was produced by erosion or faulting, that breaks the general continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces.  Exposed material is hard or soft bedrock."|"191094"
"IL099"|6|"ESO"|"Escarpment, nonbedrock"|"A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which generally is produced by erosion but can be produced by faulting, that breaks the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces.  Exposed earthy material is nonsoil or very shallow soil."|"191095"
"IL099"|6|"GPI"|"Gravel pit"|"An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and used, without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel.  Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191096"
"IL099"|6|"GRA"|"Gravelly spot"|"A spot where the surface layer has more than 35 percent, by volume, rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter in an area with less than 15 percent fragments.  Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191097"
"IL099"|6|"LVS"|"Levee"|"An embankment that confines or controls water, especially one built along the banks of a river to prevent overflow of lowlands."|"191098"
"IL099"|6|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|"A water saturated, very poorly drained area, intermittently or permanently covered by water.  Sedges, cattails, and rushes dominate marsh areas.  Trees or shrubs dominate swamps.  Not used in map units where the named components are poorly or very poorly drained.  Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191099"
"IL099"|6|"MPI"|"Mine or quarry"|"An open excavation from which soil and underlying material are removed and bedrock is exposed.  Also denotes surface openings to underground mines.  Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191100"
"IL099"|6|"MUC"|"Muck spot"|"An area with porrly drained or very poorly drained soil that has a surface layer consisting of organic soil material. The surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit consists of mineral soil material. Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191101"
"IL099"|6|"ROC"|"Rock outcrop"|"An exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth.  Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow over bedrock or where 'Rock outcrop' is a named component of the map unit.  Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191102"
"IL099"|6|"SAN"|"Sandy spot"|"A spot where the surface layer is loamy fine sand or coarser in areas where the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit is very fine sandy loam or finer.  Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191103"
"IL099"|6|"SLP"|"Short, steep slope"|"Narrow soil area that has slopes that are at least two slope classes steeper than the slope class of the surrounding map unit."|"191104"
"IL099"|6|"WET"|"Wet spot"|"A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit.  Typically .25 to 2 acres."|"191105"
