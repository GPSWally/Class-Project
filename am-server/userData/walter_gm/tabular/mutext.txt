This initiative will focus on the reconciling of map units with the same or similar names and on correlation of soil properties and interpretations across the MLRA. Map unit symbols and names will stay the same. The multiple map units and data map units will be consolidated to one national map unit symbol and one data map unit symbol. The new Flanagan data map unit will be modified using available data from existing data map units, NASIS pedons, and University of Illinois lab data. The map units will meet national and MO-11 standards. The Official Series Description will be updated as part of the process. 

This project will be looking at 154A - Flanagan silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes (21 map units) in Illinois and FgA - Flanagan silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, in Vermillion County, Indiana. This new data map unit ID (DMUID) 675979 is being created for the Soil Data Join Recorrelation (SDJR) Initiative for the 154A and FgA map units. The new data map unit is created from a copy of the old DMUIID. The new data map unit will be modified using all available data from review of existing data map units, NASIS pedons, and University of Illinois laboratory data. 

Minor components were determined by evaluating what was listed as minor components in the published soil surveys along with what was populated in NASIS. The list was evaluated and the most common minor components were selected. All components were reviewed and edited. They passed all validations and requirements of National Bulletin 430-5-7. 

Flanagan soils are of large extent being correlated in MLRAs 95B, 108A, and 110 with small acreages extending into MLRAs 108B and 115C. They are mapped in central and north-central Illinois and in west-central Indiana. Within MLRA 108A there are 618,447 acres mapped Flanagan. The acreage can be revised once the project is approved by the management team and the map units are loaded into the project. The type location is in Champaign County, Illinois, in MLRA 108A.

The evaluation and assessment began with the querying of the Flanagan data map units (DMUs) and map units in NASIS. There are 21 map units and 5 DMUs for MLRA 108A. I also created a Flanagan distribution map using ArcMap to identify the survey areas and MLRAs in which Flanagan occurs. Upon further investigation inconsistencies between the geologic members and the parent materials were discovered. The Lemont Formation consists of three members: the Haeger Member as the uppermost unit, the Yorkville Member as the middle diamicton, and the Batestown Member as the lower boundary. The Yorkville Till Member extends well into the LaSalle County, Illinois, soil survey area.  The LaSalle County soil survey area is one area in which Flanagan is mapped. The Yorkville Member consists of calcareous, gray; fine textured (silty clay to silty clay loam) diamicton that contains lenses of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. However, the Flanagan soils consist of loess over loam till. In some areas-LaSalle County, in particular-Flanagan is mapped near silty clay loam till soils. Loam till is not commonly found in the Yorkville Member. Future projects involving transects need to be done on the Flanagan soils and nearby silty clay loam till soils within MLRA 108A to ascertain the type of till. The Flanagan soils occurring on the Yorkville Till Member may need to be re-correlated to a more appropriate soil. 

Within MLRA 108A, Flanagan silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes will be re-correlated to a single map unit concept and to a single NASIS map unit record. The data map unit (DMU) will be fully populated with the required data element. The TUDs from the original soil survey reports will be located, updated, and entered into NASIS (if need be). The TUD locations will also be located on screen to make sure they fall into the Flanagan units. Additionally, the Flanagan pedons that were previously sampled will be classified to the latest version of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy and linked to the Flanagan DMU record.

Elburn is a benchmark soil and is classified as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Argiudolls. The Elburn series consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and the underlying stratified loamy outwash. Elburn soils occur on outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C (46 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 991 mm (32 to 39 inches). Frost free days range from 140 to 180. Elevation ranges from 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1,020 feet) above sea level. The Elburn series is correlated in Illinois and Wisconsin. It is of large extent across MLRAs 95B, 108A, 108B, and 110. The type location is currently in Christian County, Illinois, in MLRA 108B.

Through the evaluation and assessment process it was determined that within this office's area of responsibility: 1) there are currently 14 map units named Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes with different national map unit symbols but the same local symbol (Bureau, Champaign, DeKalb, DeWitt, Douglas, Edgar, Kendall, LaSalle, Macon, Marshall, McLean, Piatt, Vermilion, and Woodford Counties, IL); 2) the map units are correlated primarily in MLRA 108A but do extend into MLRAs 95B, 108B, 110, and 115C; 3) there are 113,574 acres correlated in MLRA 108A; 4) there are five different data mapunit records (DMU IDs 140573, 140769, 142725, 153471, and 399244); 5) Elburn occurs primarily on outwash plains and stream terraces but does include till plains; 6) there are 13 pedons correlated as Elburn entered in NASIS that are located within MLRA 108A; and 7) there are three pedons correlated as Elburn in the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) database located within MLRA 108A.

With the permission of the 11-SPR, Springfield, Illinois office, the Elburn correlated primarily in the MLRA 108B subsets will be included in this proposed SDJR project. There are 13 map units named Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes with different national map unit symbols but the same local symbol (Christian, Fulton, Henry, Lee, Logan, Mason, Menard, Ogle, Peoria, Sangamon, Stark, Tazewell, and Whiteside Counties, IL); 2) there are 76,431 acres correlated in MLRA 108B; 3) in addition to the data mapunit records previously mentioned there is one additional record (DMU ID 139419); and 4) Elburn occurs primarily on outwash plains and stream terraces but does include till plains. 

In addition, with the approval of the appropriate SSOs, the Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes correlated in Kane County (5667 acres), Elburn silt loam correlated in Shelby County (6961 acres), and Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes in Stephenson County (2033 acres) will be included in this project. There is one additional data mapunit record (DMU ID 137222) to be consolidated.  The remainder of the Elburn map units correlated in Illinois counties that are primarily located in MLRA 95B will be managed by the 11-JUN Juneau, Wisconsin office.

There will be a total of 30 map units named Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes or similarly named which will be recorrelated to a single map unit concept named Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. Seven data mapunits will be recorrelated to a single data mapunit. The new map unit will meet national standards. The DMU will be fully populated with a national set of data elements using available data from existing data mapunits, pedons, and transects. Lab data for Elburn and similar soils which is available from the KSSL database and/or state university will be referenced. The components of the representative DMUs will be correlated to current soil series, the soil series will have updated OSDs that encompasses the component properties, and the taxonomic class of the components of the DMUs and the OSD will be updated to the latest version of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Relevant pedons, primarily TUDs, will be entered into NASIS, and representative component pedons will be selected.

Several tentative field projects were identified during the initial evaluation and assessment. The first includes the sampling of the OSD site for complete characterization to a depth of 200 cm. Second, Elburn is correlated in several MLRAs. It may be necessary to conduct field investigations comparing the soil properties of the Elburn series across the different MLRAs. A third investigation would include taking deep borings to 200 cm to examine the nature and variability of the lower parent material (outwash) with relation to the different landforms, i.e. outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains. These findings might lead to further separation of Elburn map units correlated within a county based on landforms. A final project would be to determine if Elburn map units on low elevation stream terraces should be assigned a flooding frequency. One county in particular to evaluate is Fulton County where a majority of Elburn map units are on terraces adjacent to the Illinois and Spoon Rivers.

Elburn soils are the major component making up 88 to 100 percent of the map unit. Included with these soils in mapping are: small areas of poorly drained Drummer soils (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls) which make up 0 to 9 percent of the unit; and poorly drained Thorp soils (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic, Argiaquic Argialbolls) which make up 0 to 9 percent of the unit. 

The type location is located in MLRA 108B in Christian County, Illinois. 

A future need of this map unit is to determine if any significant differences may exist with the outwash in relation to landform type (outwash plain vs. stream terrace).

Catlin is classified as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls. The Catlin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on till plains. These soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy calcareous till. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature is 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 890 mm (35 inches). The Catlin Series is also a benchmark soil for MLRA 108A.

Drummer is classified as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls. The Drummer series formed in 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and the underlying loamy stratified outwash. These soils are poorly drained and are on nearly level or depressional parts of outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains of Wisconsinan Age. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees Celsius (46 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit); mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 millimeters (29 to 40 inches); frost free period ranges from 160 to 180 days; and elevation ranges from 152 to 311 meters (500 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level. 

Drummer is of large extent-correlated in MLRAs 95B, 97, 108A, 108B, 110, 111C, 111D, 113, 114A, 114B, 115A, 115C, and 121. Some of the Drummer soils mapped have gravelly substratum or stratified sandy substratum phases and will not be included in this SDJR project. These phases are found in Benton and Warren Counties, in MLRAs 110, 111C, 111D, and a little bit in 108A. These substratum phases will be investigated separately in a field project. The following Drummer mapunits will also be investigated in a separate Drummer SDJR project and given a different map unit name: 1) the Drummer soils that occur in MLRAs 114A, 114B, and 121, and 2) the map units that occur in MLRA 115A in Southern Indiana (Knox, Daviess, Pike, Gibson, Warrick, Posey, and Spencer Counties) should be investigated with 114A, 114B, and 121. The Drummer map unit from Edgar County (MLRA 115A occurs in a small extent in Edgar County) is included in this project. More than 500,000 acres have been correlated in Illinois alone but total acreage is just less than 1,500,000 acres. The acreage can be revised once the project is approved by the management team and the map units are loaded into the project. The type location is in Champaign County, Illinois, in MLRA 108A. 

The evaluation and assessment began with the querying of the legends by MLRA in NASIS and loading the Drummer map units and data map units for those selected MLRAs. There are 40 Drummer map units and 10 data map units. I also created a Drummer distribution map using ArcMap to identify the survey areas and MLRAs in which Drummer occurs. In ArcMap I loaded the NAIP photography for Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana from the GIS Image Servers and the gridded SSURGO data for Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. From the SSURGO data I queried only the Drummer soils. From only analyzing the Drummer soils I could ascertain the variants and the gravelly or sandy substratum phases and exclude them from the project. I also queried the Drummer pedons in NASIS, exported them into a text file, and loaded that text file into an Excel spreadsheet. I added the Excel file to ArcMap, added coordinate data to the map for the pedons, and then created a Drummer pedon shape file. Once that was done I was able to edit the data and determine which pedons were located in Drummer units. This analysis revealed several future field projects: 1) investigate/separate the Drummer soils that are eventually underlain by till from the Drummer soils underlain by deep outwash, 2) possibly separate the Drummer on stream terraces from the Drummer on outwash plains. This may or may not be an extensive area, and 3) the Drummer soils with gravelly or sandy substratum phases require field work. Transects, full profile descriptions, and analysis of the land forms and geology will be done to determine if the Drummer soils need to be re-correlated to a different soil series. An investigation of the Drummer silty clay loams, undifferentiated group, mapped in Warren County, IN, can also be investigated simultaneously with the substratum phases. This map unit identified 2 different Drummer soils, one with a stratified sandy substratum. These map units are probably similar to the other gravelly and sandy substratum phases identified in Benton County, IN. 

A field investigation could be done in conjunction with the future SDJR - MLRA 108A - Elpaso silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes project. Transects should be run on Drummer and Elpaso polygons mapped in broader swales on till plains. Potentially these units may better correlate to the undifferentiated group Drummer and Elpaso silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. Some Drummer map units in the southern MLRA 108A counties (Coles, Macon, Moultrie, Macon, and Piatt) were correlated to Drummer-Milford silty clay loams, 0 to 2 percent slopes. Even though lake plains is not mentioned as a landform for Drummer those areas in the above mentioned counties-which appear as lake plains-could be investigated for the presence of Milford. 

From the analysis it was noted that Drummer map units in the Boone County soil survey area join to Mahalasville silty clay loam soils in Rock and Walworth Counties. Mahalasville silty clay loam is classified as Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls and Drummer silty clay loam is classified as Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls. These Drummer map units that are mapped in Winnebago (5v0v), McHenry (63tw), and Boone (1htzc) Soil Survey areas fall into MLRA 95B. Transects need to be done to ascertain a range in characteristics and also to determine the presence of an argillic horizon. The Drummer soils in these areas could potentially be recorrelated to different series. Additionally, Kenosha and Racine Counties mapped 'Drummer silt loam, gravelly substratum' (Dt). They are: 1) g8wd (Nat'l musym), 127Dt (DMU Desc), 270510 (DMUID) 2) g8zw (Nat'l musym), 131Du (DMU Desc), 270618 (DMUID), and 3) g93b (Nat'l musym), 602Dt (DMU Desc), 270911 (DMUID). These substratum phases require field investigations to determine if these soils are Drummer or if they should be re-correlated to a different series. These field projects can be done with the help of the 11-JUN Juneau, Wisconsin, crew. 

Within Illinois and Benton County, Indiana ""Drummer silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes"" will be re-correlated to a single map unit concept and to a single NASIS map unit record. The data map unit (DMU) will be fully populated with the required data element. The TUDs from the original soil survey reports will be located, updated, and entered into NASIS (if need be). The TUD locations will also be located on screen to make sure they fall in the Drummer units. Additionally, the Drummer pedons that were previously sampled be classified to the latest version of the 'Keys to Soil Taxonomy' and linked to the Drummer DMU record. "|"1029931"|"826981"

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches). 
 
Drummer silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, classifies as Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls.

This map unit is correlated in Illinois and Indiana and occurs primarily in MLRAs 108A and 108B and extends into MLRAs 95B, 97, 110, 111C, 111D, 113, 114B, 115A, and 115C. 

Drummer soils are the major component making up 90 to 100 percent of the map unit. Included with these soils in mapping are: small areas of Harpster poorly drained soils (Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciaquolls) which make up 0 to 9 percent of the unit; and Peotone very poorly drained soils (Fine, smectitic, mesic, Cumulic Vertic Endoaquolls) which make up 0 to 9 percent of the unit.

Elpaso soils are classified as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls. They consist of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and the underlying till. Elpaso soils occur on till plains and moraines on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 1,020 mm (32 to 40 inches). Frost free days range from 140 to 180. Elevation ranges from 195 to 311 meters (640 to 1,020 feet) above sea level. The Elpaso series is correlated only in Illinois. It is of large extent across MLRAs 95B, 108A, 110, and 115C. The type location is in Woodford County, Illinois, in MLRA 108A.

Through the evaluation and assessment process it was determined that:  1) there are 13 map units named Elpaso silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes with different national map unit symbols but the same local symbol (Bureau, DeKalb, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, LaSalle, Lee, Marshall, Ogle, Putnam, Stark, Will, and Woodford Counties); 2) the map units are correlated primarily in MLRA 108A but do extend into MLRAs 95B, 108B, 110, and 115C; 3) there are two different data mapunit records (DMU IDs 140595 and 143780); 4) there are 11 Elpaso pedons entered in NASIS; and 5) there is one pedon correlated as Elpaso in the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) database located within MLRA 108A.

Elpaso was correlated in the initial soil surveys of Marshall and Woodford Counties and was identified as Drummer till substratum in the initial soil survey of Putnam County. Elpaso was correlated in the remaining counties during MLRA update activities. Areas of Drummer soils which were mapped primarily in narrow drainageways within dissected ground and end moraines were correlated to Elpaso.

Elpaso silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes will be recorrelated to a single map unit concept and to a single data mapunit. The new map unit will meet national standards. The DMU will be fully populated with a national set of data elements using available data from existing data mapunits, pedons, and transects. Lab data for Elpaso and similar soils which is available from the KSSL database and/or state university will be referenced. The components of the representative DMU will be correlated to current soil series, the soil series will have updated OSDs that encompasses the component properties, and the taxonomic class of the components of the DMU and the OSD will be updated to the latest version of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Relevant pedons, primarily TUDs, will be entered into NASIS, and a representative component pedon will be selected.

Several tentative field projects were identified during the initial evaluation and assessment. The first includes the sampling of the OSD site for complete characterization to a depth of 200 cm. Second, after reviewing the distribution map, it is apparent Elpaso is correlated in several MLRAs. It may be necessary to conduct field investigations comparing the soil properties of the Elpaso series across the various MLRAs. In particular the clay and sand contents of the 2B and 2C horizons should be compared between the various geologic formations and/or till members. A final investigation could take place in conjunction with the future SDJR - MLRA 108A -  Drummer silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes project. Transects should be run on Drummer and Elpaso polygons mapped in broader swales on till plains. Potentially these units may better correlate to the undifferentiated group Drummer and Elpaso silty clay loams, 0 to 2 percent slopes."|"1029933"|"827236"
