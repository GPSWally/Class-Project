Catlin is classified as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls. The Catlin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on till plains. These soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy calcareous till. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature is 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 890 mm (35 inches). The Catlin Series is also a benchmark soil for MLRA 108A. 

Catlin silt loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes is of large extent (191,412) in Illinois. It is mapped mostly in MLRA 108A with minor acreages spilling over into 95B, 108B, 110, and 115C. The OSD type location is in Ogle County, Illinois; about 1 1/2 miles south and 2 1/2 miles east of Monroe Center; 650 feet south and 571 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 36, T. 42 N., R. 2 E.; USGS Fairdale topographic quadrangle; lat. 42 degrees 04 minutes 38 seconds N., and long. 88 degrees 57 minutes 17 seconds W., UTM Zone 16338307 Easting and 4660199 Northing; NAD83. 

During the evaluation it was identified that currently there are 21 Catlin silt loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (171B) map units correlated in Illinois with six different data map units. 171B is mapped in: Bureau, Champaign, DeKalb, De Witt, Douglas, Edgar, Kane, Kendall, LaSalle, Lee, Logan, Macon, Marshall, McLean, Ogle, Piatt, Putnam, Shelby, Stark, Vermillion, and Woodford Counties. The distribution of Catlin appears to reflect the front of the Wisconsin Glacial advance, the few map units mapped outside of the glaciation will need to be reviewed in a future field project.

For now, the map units in Illinois will be reviewed as one physiographic area, and that project is assigned to the 11-AUR, Aurora, Illinois office for re-correlation. In the IL the map unit phases are (Catlin silt loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes). The consolidation project will reduce the number of map units and data map units to as few national map unit symbols as possible. The new data map unit will be created using available data from existing data map units, NASIS pedons, and KSSL and university lab data. The map units will meet national standards. The official series descriptions will be reviewed and updated during this process, as will all of the KSSL samples. Relevant pedons, primarily TUDs, will be entered into NASIS, and a representative component pedon will be selected.

Several tentative field projects were identified during the initial evaluation and assessment. After reviewing the distribution map, it is apparent Catlin is correlated in several MLRAs. It may be necessary to conduct field investigations comparing the soil properties of the Catlin series across the various MLRAs. Also the limited lab data suggests that the 2C horizon may be densic as the bulk density is near or at 1.78 g/cm3. Bulk density studies will need to be conducted along with visual evidence of root distribution in the 2C horizon.

Elburn is a benchmark soil and is classified as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Argiudolls. The Elburn series consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and the underlying stratified loamy outwash. Elburn soils occur on outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C (46 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 991 mm (32 to 39 inches). Frost free days range from 140 to 180. Elevation ranges from 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1,020 feet) above sea level. The Elburn series is correlated in Illinois and Wisconsin. It is of large extent across MLRAs 95B, 108A, 108B, and 110. The type location is currently in Christian County, Illinois, in MLRA 108B.

Through the evaluation and assessment process it was determined that within this office's area of responsibility: 1) there are currently 14 map units named Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes with different national map unit symbols but the same local symbol (Bureau, Champaign, DeKalb, DeWitt, Douglas, Edgar, Kendall, LaSalle, Macon, Marshall, McLean, Piatt, Vermilion, and Woodford Counties, IL); 2) the map units are correlated primarily in MLRA 108A but do extend into MLRAs 95B, 108B, 110, and 115C; 3) there are 113,574 acres correlated in MLRA 108A; 4) there are five different data mapunit records (DMU IDs 140573, 140769, 142725, 153471, and 399244); 5) Elburn occurs primarily on outwash plains and stream terraces but does include till plains; 6) there are 13 pedons correlated as Elburn entered in NASIS that are located within MLRA 108A; and 7) there are three pedons correlated as Elburn in the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) database located within MLRA 108A.

With the permission of the 11-SPR, Springfield, Illinois office, the Elburn correlated primarily in the MLRA 108B subsets will be included in this proposed SDJR project. There are 13 map units named Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes with different national map unit symbols but the same local symbol (Christian, Fulton, Henry, Lee, Logan, Mason, Menard, Ogle, Peoria, Sangamon, Stark, Tazewell, and Whiteside Counties, IL); 2) there are 76,431 acres correlated in MLRA 108B; 3) in addition to the data mapunit records previously mentioned there is one additional record (DMU ID 139419); and 4) Elburn occurs primarily on outwash plains and stream terraces but does include till plains. 

In addition, with the approval of the appropriate SSOs, the Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes correlated in Kane County (5667 acres), Elburn silt loam correlated in Shelby County (6961 acres), and Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes in Stephenson County (2033 acres) will be included in this project. There is one additional data mapunit record (DMU ID 137222) to be consolidated.  The remainder of the Elburn map units correlated in Illinois counties that are primarily located in MLRA 95B will be managed by the 11-JUN Juneau, Wisconsin office.

There will be a total of 30 map units named Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes or similarly named which will be recorrelated to a single map unit concept named Elburn silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. Seven data mapunits will be recorrelated to a single data mapunit. The new map unit will meet national standards. The DMU will be fully populated with a national set of data elements using available data from existing data mapunits, pedons, and transects. Lab data for Elburn and similar soils which is available from the KSSL database and/or state university will be referenced. The components of the representative DMUs will be correlated to current soil series, the soil series will have updated OSDs that encompasses the component properties, and the taxonomic class of the components of the DMUs and the OSD will be updated to the latest version of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Relevant pedons, primarily TUDs, will be entered into NASIS, and representative component pedons will be selected.

Several tentative field projects were identified during the initial evaluation and assessment. The first includes the sampling of the OSD site for complete characterization to a depth of 200 cm. Second, Elburn is correlated in several MLRAs. It may be necessary to conduct field investigations comparing the soil properties of the Elburn series across the different MLRAs. A third investigation would include taking deep borings to 200 cm to examine the nature and variability of the lower parent material (outwash) with relation to the different landforms, i.e. outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains. These findings might lead to further separation of Elburn map units correlated within a county based on landforms. A final project would be to determine if Elburn map units on low elevation stream terraces should be assigned a flooding frequency. One county in particular to evaluate is Fulton County where a majority of Elburn map units are on terraces adjacent to the Illinois and Spoon Rivers.

Streator soils are classified as fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Endoaquolls. They consist of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 inches) of loess or other silty material and the underlying clayey till or lakebed sediments. Streator soils occur on till plains or lake beds of Wisconsinan Age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.7 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1020 mm (30 to 40 inches). The Streator series is correlated in Illinois. It is of moderate extent across MLRAs 108A and 110. The OSD type location is in Marshall County, Illinois, in MLRA 108A.

Through the evaluation and assessment process it was determined that: 1) there are four map units named Streator silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes with different national map unit symbols but the same local symbol (LaSalle, Livingston, Marshall, and Woodford Counties); 2) the map units are correlated primarily in MLRA 108A but do extend into MLRA 110; 3) there are two different data mapunit records (DMU IDs 140604 and 462683); 4) there are 13 pedons correlated as Streator located within MLRA 108A that are in the NASIS database; and 5) there are three pedons correlated as Streator that are in the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) database.

Streator silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes will be recorrelated to a single map unit concept and to a single data mapunit. The new map unit will meet national standards. The DMU will be fully populated with a national set of data elements using available data from existing data mapunits, pedons, and transects. Lab data for Streator and similar soils which is available from the KSSL database and/or state university will be referenced. The components of the representative DMU will be correlated to current soil series, the soil series will have updated OSDs that encompasses the component properties, and the taxonomic class of the components of the DMU and the OSD will be updated to the latest version of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Relevant pedons, primarily TUDs and/or map unit reps, will be entered into NASIS, and a representative component pedon will be selected.

One tentative field project was identified during the initial evaluation and assessment. It involves the sampling of the OSD site for complete characterization to a depth of 200 cm.

Based on the distribution map of this soil and other associated soils in LaSalle, Marshall, and Woodford Counties, it appears revisions of the MLRA boundaries are in order. MLRA 110 boundaries should be extended into the current area of MLRA 108A where these heavy till plain soils occur."|"182197"|"828906"

It is yet to be determined if Vermillion County IL and the three counties in Indiana will use the new data mapunit that was reviewed and edited for this project.  The mapunits in the Illinois part of MLRA 105 will be included in this project.  The map units in this project will be consolidated to have consistent data population wherever the map unit was mapped. Map unit symbols and names will stay the same for this project, which includes 41 counties in Illinois, and 1 county in Wisconsin (Dane).  The new map unit and new data mapunit will meet national and MO11 standards.  The Official Series Description will be updated as a part of this process. 
This project will be looking at 68A - Sable silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. The map unit in this project is mapped in 41 counties in IL and 1 county in Wisconsin, and has 6 data mapunits. This SDJR project will consolidate the number of map units and data map units to one for the 42 counties.
This new data mapunit, DMUID 700463, is being created for the Soil Data Join Recorrelation (SDJR) Initiative for the 68A - Sable silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, map unit. This data mapunit is created from a copy of DMUID 155134.  
Data mapunit population was conducted using lab data for the Sable series from the KSSL and UofIL characterization database, and pedon data entered into NASIS.  The data was downloaded, reviewed, and aggregated for data population. The data was filtered for the different horizons and then statistics performed to find average, min, and max for various properties.  These values were used to help populate the Sable data mapunit.  Data from the existing DMUs were also taken into consideration. The DMU passed all validations and requirements of National Bulletin 430-305, November 2013. 
The new Data map unit was then reviewed for consistency by using a variety of interpretation reports.  Changes were made to the DMU as needed.
Minor components were determined by evaluating what was listed as minor components in the published soil surveys.  The list was evaluated and the most common minor dissimilar components were selected.  Minor components that were not used in NASIS were recognized in a mapunit text note.
