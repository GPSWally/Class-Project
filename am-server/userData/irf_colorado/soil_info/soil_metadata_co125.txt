  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
      detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
      maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
      and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
      sensed and other information.

      This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
      computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
      extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
      of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
      pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
      the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
      features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
      too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
      enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
      management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
      National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
      the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
    Purpose:
      SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
      soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
      product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
      associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
      available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
      Contact.

    This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
    in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
    source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
    organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
    needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate

    Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
    for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
    than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
    of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
    contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
    depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
    them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
    detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
    and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
    Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
    users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Attribute accuracy is tested by manual
      comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
      display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
      Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
      on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
      addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
      attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
      the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
    are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
    (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
    requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
    must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
    nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
    element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
    the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
    consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
    polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
    on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
    adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
    not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.
    The boundary of this survey is matched to the adjacent SSURGO
    certified surveys of Phillips County, Colorado, Logan County,
    Colorado, Washington County, Colorado, Kit Carson County, Colorado,
    Cheyenne County, Kansas, Dundy County, Nebraska and Chase County,
    Nebraska. Feature edges and labels do not match.
  Completeness_Report:
    A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
    their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
    unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
    each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
    on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
    on the map is a delineation.

    Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
    that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
    named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
    may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
    on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
    not be indicated on the map.

    A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
    (map unit components), each with a designated range in
    proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
    or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
    or no recognizable soil.

    Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
    were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
    units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
    outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
    USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
    USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
    (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
    Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

    The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
    delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
    the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
    Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
    peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
    control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
    soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
    of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
    associations, and undifferentiated groups.

    Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
    In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
    dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
    minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
    identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
    taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
    area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
    significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
    dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
    does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
    nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
    generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

    Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
    of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
    repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
    is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
    complex or association is used in the name. The major components
    of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
    either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
    in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
    consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
    each major component is normally present though their proportions
    may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
    amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
    the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
    25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
    inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

    Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
    or more components that are not consistently associated
    geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
    the same map delineation. These components are included in the
    same named map unit because their use and management are the same
    or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
    because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
    flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
    additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
    included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
    major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
    regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
    consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
    principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
    undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

    Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
    descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
    one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
    transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
    3,000 acres.

    A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
    purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
    kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
    and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
    map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
    about 5 acres.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
        compilation to base maps that meet National Map
        Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
        feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
        soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
        field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
        locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
        with the transition between map units.

        For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
        occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
        abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
        narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
        generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
        the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
        between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
        matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
        locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
        by more than 0.01 inch.

      Process_Description:
        Yuma County, Colorado, has a previously published soil survey,
        1981, at 1:24000 scale. The soil survey classification and map
        unit names were finalized at the final correlation in July, 1976.
        An evaluation was made of the soil survey in 2004 and map unit
        components were accurate.

      Process_Date: 2004
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Publication composite film positive atlas sheet overlays were
        scanned at 300 DPI, 8 bits per pixel (grayscale). Each scanned
        atlas sheet was georeferenced using the four corners of the
        quadrangle boundary as initial horizontal reference then using
        the USGS digital orthophotographs as interior horizontal
        reference, using Leica Geosystems ERDAS 8.6 Orthobase software.
        The National Elevation Dataset (NED) was used as the vertical
        reference.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Publication soil delineation and annotation film positive
        overlays were scanned at 600 DPI, 1 bit per pixel (monochrome).
        Each scanned soil delineation and annotation image was
        georeferenced using the analytical solution of the previously
        georeferenced atlas sheet, using Leica Geosystems ERDAS 8.6
        Orthobase software. The National Elevation Dataset (NED) was used
        as the vertical reference.

      Process_Date: 2004
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The soil map unit boundaries were extracted to vector format from
        the referenced soil delineation images using Ablesoft R2V version
        5.5041012. Neatlines were removed from the vector data and edge
        matching performed using ESRI ArcInfo 9.0. Map unit closure and
        topology construction were performed to build a county-wide
        polygon layer using ArcInfo 9.0 and ArcGIS 9.0.

      Process_Date: 2004
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Each referenced annotation image was converted to a point file
        representing map unit labels using Ablesoft R2V OCR engine. Each
        map unit polygon was compared to annotation points and assigned
        the annotation value where no conflicts occurred. Conflicts were
        resolved by manually assigning the soil map unit label to the
        corresponding polygon. The soil map unit layer was exported to
        a polygon shapefile.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Special soil feature spot symbols were extracted from the
        georeferenced annotation images using Ablesoft R2V software,
        labels were assigned using the Ablesoft OCR engine. Symbol
        labeling conflicts were isolated and resolved manually by
        underlaying the georeferenced atlas sheets and manually assigning
        the spot symbol label. The spot symbols were exported to a point
        shapefile.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Shapefiles of the soil map unit polygons and special soil
        feature points were submitted to the NRCS Regional SSURGO
        Digitizing Center in Salina, Kansas for final editing and SSURGO
        review. The shapefiles were converted to personal geodatabase
        format and edited using ArcGIS 8.3. The extent of the soil survey
        boundary was matched to the adjacent SSURGO certified soil
        surveys of Phillips County, Colorado, Logan County, Colorado,
        Washington County, Colorado, Kit Carson County, Colorado,
        Cheyenne County, Kansas, Dundy County, Nebraska and Chase County,
        Nebraska. For quality control, a ten percent quality assurance
        review was done by a senior soil scientist at the MLRA Office in
        Salina, Kansas. The spatial data, metadata and tabular files were
        evaluated by staff at the Kansas Digitizing Center, using ArcGIS
        8.3 and the May 2004 ArcInfo SSURGO Evaluation AMLs provided by
        the NRCS National Cartography and Geospatial Center (NCGC). The

        National Soil Bulletin 430-5-7. The major changes to the dataset
        involved population of Albedo dry, Component 3D Surface Morphometry,
        Component Slope Shape, Component Aspect, Component Parent Material, and
        Horizon Structure for the surface mineral layer only. The Brief Map
        Unit Description Report was also calculated. All National
        Interpretations, Department of Homeland Security, and Military
        Interpretations were included in the export. All obsolete stored
        interpretations, with the exception of Hydric, in the Component
        Interpretations table were deleted. Slope shape and slope aspect were
        determined from DEMs utilizing ArcGIS tools. Where multiple slope
        shapes and slope aspects were determined for a map unit, the
        predominant slope shape, or slope aspect, was entered as the RV for all
        components in the map unit. Values for Albedo were populated for
        components where a taxonomic unit description was available. For many
        higher taxons (boralfs, cryoboralfs) in the older surveys a
        representative profile description was not available to assign Albedo.
        Albedo was left blank for these components.

      Entity_Type_Label: Special Soil Features
      Entity_Type_Definition:
        Special Soil Features represent soil, miscellaneous area, or landform
        features that are too small to be digitized as soil delineations
        (area features).

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Special Soil Features Codes
      Attribute_Definition:
        Special Soil Features labels represent specific Special Soil
        Features. These features are identified with a descriptive
        label. The label is assigned to the point or line assigned
        to represent the feature on maps.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
      by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
      similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
      of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

      The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
      delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The map
      unit key is used to link to information in the National Soil
      Information System tables.

      Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
      Information System database. This attribute database gives the
      proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
      each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
      on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
      interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
      agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

      The National Soil Information System database contains static
      metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
      information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
      are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
      database objects. Attributes include table and column
      descriptions and detailed domain information.

      The National Soil Information System database also contains a
      distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
      map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
      data.

      Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes
      an area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description
      for each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
