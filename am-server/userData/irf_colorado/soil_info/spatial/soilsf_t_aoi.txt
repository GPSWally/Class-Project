"CO125"|8|"WET"|"Wet spot"|"A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit.  Typically 0.5 to 5 acres."|"186850"
"CO125"|8|"SHA"|"Shale outcrop"|"An exposure of shale bedrock at the surface of the earth.  Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow over bedrock.  Typically 0.5 to 5 acres."|"186849"
"CO125"|8|"SAN"|"Sandy spot"|"A spot where the surface layer is loamy fine sand or coarser in areas where the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit is very fine sandy loam or finer.  Typically 0.5 to 5 acres."|"186848"
"CO125"|8|"SAL"|"Saline spot"|"An area where the surface layer has an electrical conductivity of 8 mmhos cm -1 more than the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit, which has an EC of 2 mmhos cm -1 or less.  Typically 0.5 to 5 acres."|"186847"
"CO125"|8|"ROC"|"Rock outcrop"|"An exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth.  Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow over bedrock or where 'Rock outcrop' is a named component of the map unit.  Typically 0.5 to 5 acres."|"186846"

"CO125"|8|"ERO"|"Severely eroded spot"|"An area where on the average 75 percent or more of the original surface layer has been lost because of accelerated erosion.  Not used in map units that are named severely eroded, very severely eroded, or gullied.  Typically 0.5 to 5 acres."|"186841"
