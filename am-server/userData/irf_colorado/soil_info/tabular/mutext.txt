Future Maintenance Needs:
Future maintenance should determine the exact nature of the Haxtun buried horizon and if the Haxtun OSD should have the requirement of a buried horizon.

Maintenance needs to also determine the surface textures of the Haxtun sandy loam and Haxtun loamy sand mapunits where they adjoin each other and define the minor component composition of this mapunit because the manuscripts and datamapunits do not agree.

Maintenance should determine the geomorphic descriptions of the Haxtun and Ascalon components because the manuscripts and datamapunits do not define their positions on the landscape.

Maintenance should also determine if the Loup soil series is the correct soil for the swale positions because it was added without field investigation to this mapunit during the SDJR process to represent the Depression, Pot Hole, and Wet Spot spot symbols, which we are assuming were represented by the Rago component in Logan and Phillips counties.

Maintenance should also reconcile the many spatial and tabular join mismatches (see the County Line Joins section below for details).

Manuscript Comparison:
The concepts in the original soil survey manuscripts are similar, but the geomorphology descriptions, land capability classifications, mapunit inclusions, and parent material are different. 

Geomorphology Descriptions
The geomorphology descriptions in the manuscripts are listed below by county symbol. The new MLRA mapunit geomorphology description will be rises on tablelands.

Logan (CO075)		upland valleys and flats
Phillips (CO095)	uplands
Sedgwick (CO115)	uplands, but some small areas are on terraces of the South Platte River 
Washington (CO121)	slightly depressed areas on smooth plains
Yuma (CO125)		swale and sand hill valleys. 

Land Capability Class 
The land capability classes (LCC) in the manuscripts are listed below by county symbol, non-irrigated LCC, and irrigated LCC. The new MLRA mapunit LCC will be 2e for non-irrigated and irrigated land.

Logan (CO075)		2e/2e
Phillips (CO095)	2e/2e
Sedgwick (CO115)	3e/not classified
Washington (CO121)	2e/2e
Yuma (CO125)		2e/2e

Minor Components
The minor components in the manuscripts are listed below by county symbol. The new MLRA mapunit minor components will be Ascalon (10%).

Parent Material
The parent material descriptions in the manuscripts are listed below by county. The new MLRA mapunit parent material will be eolian deposits.

Logan (CO075) 		Eolian sandy loam deposits overlying an older buried loamy soil that formed in mixed calcareous loamy alluvial and eolian deposits
Phillips (CO095)	Loamy sand or sandy loams
Sedgwick (CO115)	Mixture of silty and sandy eolian materials over sand and gravel
Washington (CO121)	Eolian sand
Yuma (CO125)		Mixed eolian and alluvium material overlying an older buried soil

Original Manuscript and Correlated Datamapunit Comparison:
The differences between the manuscripts and the datamapunits are the geomorphic descriptions, the land capability class (LCC), minor component composition. 

Geomorphic Descriptions
The Phillips County (CO095) manuscript had an upland geomorphic description. The supporting datamapunit for supporting datamapunit has a ridges geomorphic description.

Land Capability Class
The manuscripts for Logan (CO075) and Phillips (CO095) Counties had 2e LCC for both the non-irrigated and irrigated land, but their supporting datamapunits have a 3c for non-irrigated and a 2e for irrigated land. The Sedgwick County (CO115) manuscript had a 3e LCC for non-irrigated land and did not have a value for the irrigated land, but the supporting datamapunit has a 2e LCC for non-irrigated and irrigated land. The manuscripts for Washington (CO121) and Yuma (CO125) Counties had a 2e LCC for both non-irrigated and irrigated land, but their supporting datamapunit have a 3e LCC for non-irrigated and irrigated land.

Minor Components
The Logan County (CO075) manuscript minor components were Ascalon sandy loam, Rago loam, and Haxtun loamy sand, but the supporting datamapunit has Ascalon (10%) and Rago (10%). There were no minor components listed in the Sedgwick County manuscript, but the supporting datamapunit has Julesburg (7%), Ascalon (7%), and Rock Outcrop (1%).


Major Component Differences:
The Haxtun components interpretative ratings for the 8 datamapunits being replaced were compared. There were 8 soil properties that create interpretative rating differences for 28 interpretations. These properties are Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Clay Content, Gravel Content, Linear Extensibility Percent (LEP), Organic Matter (OM), Sand Content, Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity (Ksat), and Unified Class. 

Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)
ENG - Construction Materials; Topsoil
The limitation for this interpretation is the exchange capacity and is driven by the CEC capacity (0-100cm), which is the sum of (horz. CEC/100) * (1/3bar Db)*(layer thickness).  This value for the CO121 and CO125 Haxtun component is between 20.8-22.6 (Good) and for the CO075, CO095, and CO115 Haxtun component it is between 16.8-19 (Fair). The CEC values are prior populations of unknown origin and the new MLRA component CEC values will be derived from the national calculation.

Clay Content
GRL - Fencing, Post Depth =<24 inches
The limitation for this interpretation is 18 to 45% clay and is driven by the highest representative clay content (0-60cm). This value for the CO115 Haxtun component is 18% (Not Limited), and for the CO075, CO095, CO121, and CO125 it is between 27.5-30.5% (Limited).

Gravel Content
DHS - Suitability for Composting Medium and Final Cover

The limitation for these interpretations is shrink-swell and is driven by the wtd-avg Linear Extensibility Percent (LEP) (25-100cm). This value for the CO075, CO095, CO115, and CO125 Haxtun component is between 1.5-2.8% (Good) and for the CO121 Haxtun component it is 3.46 (Fair). The LEP values are prior populations of unknown origin and the new MLRA component LEP values will be derived from the national calculation.

The OM content for the CO075, CO095, and CO115 Haxtun component is 3% (Not Limited) and for the CO121 and CO125 it is 2.5% (Somewhat Limited). The surface OM for the new MLRA component will be 3%.

ENG - Construction Materials; Reclamation
The limitation for this interpretation is low content of organic matter and is driven by the thickest layer organic matter content (0-180cm). This value for the CO075, CO095, CO115, and CO125 Haxtun component is between 0.25-0.75% (Fair), and for the CO121 Haxtun component it is 1.25% (Good).

Sand Content
ENG - Construction Materials; Sand Source
The limitation for this interpretation is the thickest layer and is driven by the total sand content of the thickest layer. This value for the CO075, CO095, CO115, and CO125 Haxtun components is between 53-63% (Fair), and for the CO121 Haxtun component it is 44% (Poor).

The Ksat values for the new MLRA component will be populated following the MLRA 72 Ksat scheme based on the RV texture class.

DHS - Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit
DHS - Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench

This value for the CO075, CO095, CO115, and CO125 Haxtun component is between 23-73 um/s (Limited) and for the CO121 Haxtun component it is 3 um/s (Not Limited). The Ksat values for the new MLRA component will be populated following the MLRA 72 Ksat scheme based on the RV texture class.

The Ksat values for the new MLRA component will be populated following the MLRA 72 Ksat scheme based on the RV texture class.

WMS - Irrigation, General
WMS - Irrigation, Surface (graded)

The Ksat values for the new MLRA component will be populated following the MLRA 72 Ksat scheme based on the RV texture class.

Unified Class
DHS - Site for Composting Facility  Surface
WMS - Embankments, Dikes, and Levees
The limitation for this interpretation is piping and is driven by the Unified Dominant Condition (25-200cm). Dominant condition is the Unified Class with the greatest thickness within the 25-200cm zone. This value for the CO075 and CO121 Haxtun component is cl (Somewhat Limited) and for the CO095, CO115, and CO125 Haxtun component it is cl-ml (Very Limited). These are prior populations of unknown origin and the new MLRA components Unified classes will be derived from the national calculation.
