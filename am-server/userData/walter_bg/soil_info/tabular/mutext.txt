Currently, this map unit is mapped in 42 counties in IL, 3 counties in Indiana, and 2 counties in Wisconsin, and has 13 data mapunits. It is yet to be determined if Vermillion County IL and the three counties in Indiana will use the new data mapunit that was reviewed and edited for this project.  The mapunits in the Illinois part of MLRA 105 will be included in this project.  The map units in this project will be consolidated to have consistent data population wherever the map unit was mapped. Map unit symbols and names will stay the same for this project, which includes 41 counties in Illinois, and 1 county in Wisconsin (Dane).  The new map unit and new data mapunit will meet national and MO11 standards.  The Official Series Description will be updated as a part of this process. 
This project will be looking at 68A - Sable silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. The map unit in this project is mapped in 41 counties in IL and 1 county in Wisconsin, and has 6 data mapunits. This SDJR project will consolidate the number of map units and data map units to one for the 42 counties.
This new data mapunit, DMUID 700463, is being created for the Soil Data Join Recorrelation (SDJR) Initiative for the 68A - Sable silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, map unit. This data mapunit is created from a copy of DMUID 155134.  
Data mapunit population was conducted using lab data for the Sable series from the KSSL and UofIL characterization database, and pedon data entered into NASIS.  The data was downloaded, reviewed, and aggregated for data population. The data was filtered for the different horizons and then statistics performed to find average, min, and max for various properties.  These values were used to help populate the Sable data mapunit.  Data from the existing DMUs were also taken into consideration. The DMU passed all validations and requirements of National Bulletin 430-305, November 2013. 
The new Data map unit was then reviewed for consistency by using a variety of interpretation reports.  Changes were made to the DMU as needed.
Minor components were determined by evaluating what was listed as minor components in the published soil surveys.  The list was evaluated and the most common minor dissimilar components were selected.  Minor components that were not used in NASIS were recognized in a mapunit text note.

A future project will investigate loess thickness of Sable map units in MLRAs 95B, 108A and 108B.  The Sable map units in Dane Co. Wisconsin will be investigated for possible sandy substratum phases.

There is a map unit join issue at the Ogle/Winnebago County boundary.  Winnebago Co. has 9068A joining 68A in Ogle Co.  A field investigation, will be needed to correct this issue.

A future project will investigate the join issue between Jo Daviess Co. and Lafayette Co., based on surface texture differences.  This project will also investigate the impact of the ""driftless"" and glaciated landforms on the soil profile.
