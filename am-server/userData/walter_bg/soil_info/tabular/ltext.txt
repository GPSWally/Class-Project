We have completed our quality assurance review of the automated map compilation for LaSalle County, Illinois.  

1.	Materials are being returned. Some comments are marked on edit mylars in orange. 
2.	This project was hand compiled with modifications done to the original mapping based on correlation decisions, etc.   
3.	Hydro layer was not received for this project but care should be taken to make sure that the hydro image on the ortho matches the position of soil lines.
4.	Noted errors should be fixed. 
5.	NASIS should be edited to reflect the resulting spatial data.
6.	Correlation document needs to be prepared to match NASIS and spatial data.
7.	Metadata should reflect the process used.
8.	When edit comments are dealt with, sign a compilation certificate and send it for us to sign. http://www.in.nrcs.usda.gov/mlra11/Soil_Business/word/Compilation_cert.doc

We have completed our ten percent digitizing quality assurance review for LaSalle County, Illinois.  We reviewed the Leonore SE, Streater South NW, Wenona SE, Somonauk SW, Mendota East NW, Earlville SW, Wedron NE, Ladd SE, Marseilles NW, SE and Seneca SW quads.  Problem areas are marked with orange pencil.
 
1.	There were no labels indicating quad names on the check plots. 
2.	No correlation document was received with the materials.  We found one in our office.
3.	BPI special feature spot symbol was found on Seneca SW quad but is not included in the correlation document.  Be sure to check the correlation document to make sure all special feature symbols and map units correspond and corrections made as needed.
4.	We assume that common line corrections were cleared through the Illinois soil scientists who prepared the maps.  We have a LaSalle County published report but understand that is not the source material for this update.  We did not have the source material so could not check the digital data against the source for the areas we questioned.  We marked a few that we had questions about.  
5.	As indicated in the compilation QA review, many changes made in the update process are not specifically documented, as is indicated in the correlation document.   

Please review our comments.  We are enclosing a signed certification.  Please sign it and send it on to Illinois for their signature.  Please return a copy for our files.  If there are any questions, please contact Mike Wigginton at (317) 290-3200, ext. 365.
