"IA099"|7|"BLO"|"Blowout"|"A saucer-, cup-, or trough-shaped depression formed by wind erosion on a pre-existing dune or other sand deposit, especially in an area of shifting sand or loose soil or where protective vegetation is disturbed or destroyed. The adjoining accumulation of sand derived from the depression, where recognizable, is commonly included. Blowouts are commonly small.  Typically__to__acres."|"208512"
"IA099"|7|"CLR"|"FEATNAME"|"FEATDESC"|"208513"
"IA099"|7|"DEP"|"Depression, closed"|"A shallow, saucer-shaped area that is slightly lower on the landscape than the surrounding area and that does not have a natural outlet for surface drainage. Typically__to__acres."|"208514"

"IA099"|7|"ERA"|"FEATNAME"|"FEATDESC"|"208516"
"IA099"|7|"ERO"|"Severely eroded spot"|"An area where, on the average, 75 percent or more of the original surface layer has been lost because of accelerated erosion.  Not used in map units in which severely eroded, very severely eroded, or gullied is part of the map unit name.  Typically__to__acres."|"208517"
"IA099"|7|"ESB"|"Escarpment, bedrock"|"A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, produced by erosion or faulting, that breaks the general continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces. Exposed material is hard or soft bedrock."|"208518"
"IA099"|7|"ESO"|"Escarpment, nonbedrock"|"A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which generally is produced by erosion but can be produced by faulting, that breaks the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces.  Exposed earthy material is nonsoil or very shallow soil."|"208519"
"IA099"|7|"GCL"|"FEATNAME"|"FEATDESC"|"208520"
"IA099"|7|"GLA"|"FEATNAME"|"FEATDESC"|"208521"
"IA099"|7|"GPI"|"Gravel pit"|"An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and used, without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel.  Typically__to__acres."|"208522"
"IA099"|7|"GUL"|"Gully"|"A small, steep-sided channel caused by erosion and cut in unconsolidated materials by concentrated but intermittent flow of water.  The distinction between a gully and a rill is one of depth. A gully generally is an obstacle to farm machinery and is too deep to be obliterated by ordinary tillage whereas a rill is of lesser depth and can be smoothed over by ordinary tillage."|"208523"
"IA099"|7|"LVS"|"Levee"|"An embankment that confines or controls water, especially one built along the banks of a river to prevent overflow onto lowlands."|"208524"
"IA099"|7|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|"A water saturated, very poorly drained area that is intermittently or permanently covered by water. Sedges, cattails, and rushes are the dominate vegetation in marshes, and trees or shrubs are the dominant vegetation in swamps. Not used in map units where the named soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained. Typically__to__acres."|"208525"
"IA099"|7|"ROC"|"Rock outcrop"|"An exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth. Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow overbedrock or where Rock outcrop is a named component of the map unit. Typically__to__acres."|"208526"
"IA099"|7|"SAN"|"Sandy spot"|"A spot where the surface layer is loamy fine sand or coarser in areas where the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit is very fine sandy loam or finer. Typically__to__acres."|"208527"
"IA099"|7|"SHL"|"FEATNAME"|"FEATDESC"|"208528"
"IA099"|7|"WET"|"Wet spot"|"A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. Typically__to__ acres."|"208529"
